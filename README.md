# Blackjack

This is a simple, single-player, text-based Blackjack game.

When I was first introduced to programming, a friend showed me a Blackjack game they had made in java. I tried to make my own, but failed (miserably). I didn't understand OOP at all-- I tried to make the entire thing in one class called "Blackjack".

Since then, I went through some ups and downs in my education path, but eventually settled on majoring in CS. Near the end of my first Java class where I was really introduced to OOP, I decided to try again. So, this is it!

I'm going to continue updating it here and there, but I am pretty happy with how it turned out. 

Thanks for checking it out!

**Instructions:**

Clone the repository onto your machine. Navigate into the folder, compile each class using `javac *.java`, then run using `java Game.java`.
